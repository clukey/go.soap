import "aqwari.net/exp/soap"

A minimal SOAP 1.1 library. Best used together with encoding/xml,
not as a replacement. The biggest convenience it provides is
de-referencing the document-local links that plague apache Axis 2
and other "Big Enterprise" services. I may add a wsdl2go utility,
but honestly, I need a break from SOAP (the S stands for simple :))
